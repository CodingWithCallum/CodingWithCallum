# Howzit! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Callum Barry. Welcome to CodingWithCallum! #
## Who am I? ##
I am a 25 year old developer who just finished (in 2022) [his degree](https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-technology-information-studies) in application development. As of today, I am starting to journey on GitHub and look forward to producing useful content, meaningful contributions, and engage with the exciting world of development! I won't bore you with more about me other than my love for photography, passion for esports, and why Star Wars was a blessing to mankind!

## What have I done? ##
The short answer: not much, yet!  <!-- line break-->  
My mind is always buzzing (thank you ADHD) which means there is a million and one ideas for projects or topics I would love to develop or discuss. In the past, I wrote this all down into a journal, A4 notepad, or napkin so I will never forget my ideas. However, I have now decided to start taking my journaling to [Dev Community][dev] where I will use it as a blog of sorts!

Oh, and of course, I will update this "what have I done" section as I start to share more!

## Connect with me! ##
I will start sharing more of my work and journey as a developer through other platforms such as: (note: I'm still creating these accounts)
+ [Twitter][twi]
+ [LinkedIn][lin]
+ [YouTube][yt]
+ [Dev Community][dev]

## My skills as a developer ##
__I need to remember to complete this section (it's getting late at the time of writing this.... yawn__)

## What I plan on sharing next! ##
This section might not be exciting to many but this is upcoming content that I will be releasing!

+ Guide: Becoming present online as a developer! (Starting up with GitHub, blogging your journey, and finding your development niche)
+ Guide: GitHub ReadMe formatting.
